# SpaceX GraphQL API

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/WdJd2w?referralCode=xsbY2R)

This repo is a recreation of the [SpaceXLand/api](https://github.com/SpaceXLand/api) project that was authored by [Carlos Rufo](https://github.com/itscarlosrufo). The original project used a MongoDB that was deprecated in favor of Launch Library 2; you can read about the issue [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/issues/1243). The team plans to keep the REST API in place but unmaintained. This project utilized the REST API to implement the same schema, but there are some gaps that have been marked `@deprecated`; `Missions` are not available in the REST API.

If you have any questions or issues with this project, come find us on Discord to talak about it!
